# TDT4200 Problem Set 1

## What is the von Neumann bottleneck? Give one example of how we can try to overcome the von Neumann bottleneck.

Programs made for von Neumann architectures essentially become read-modify-write cycles. This has the consequence that the processor will be working at the speed of memory which is usually slower.

Things that may help:

- Caching certainly helps in reducing reads and deferring writes.
- Find an alternative to von Neumann that doesn't completely break existing programs.
- Force parallelization into von Neumann programs.

## Look at the code below. Does it contain a data, name or control dependency? Justify your answer.

```c
int a[100], b[100];

for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    b[i] = i;
    a[i] = 2*b[i];
    b[i] = i*i;
}
```

We have a data dependence as `b[i]` is first assigned and then used as an input. A good compiler might be able to optimize this dependency away by replacing the input with `i`.

We then have a name dependency as the result of `b[i]` is used in `a` and is then overwritten.

We can't start working on the next iteration as `i` is used inside the loop while also being the loop condition. Therefore we have a control dependency.


## What is the difference between SIMD and MIMD in Flynnâ€™s taxonomy?

SIMD allows us to run an instruction an multiple operands. Everything still happens in sequence.

MIMD enables us to process multiple instructions on multiple operands simultaneously.

## Collect and document the execution time of the integration loop when using the different solvers (Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, and Red-black Gauss-Seidel). Comment on the amount of computational work vs. the execution time for the different solvers.

**Jacobi**: 3'869'716 iterations, 53.961263 seconds, pretty fast but needs lots of iterations.

**Gauss-Seidel**: 3'079'497 iterations, 73.391418 seconds, a lot slower but takes way less iterations.

**Red-Black Gauss-Seidel**: 2'826'014 iterations, 37.995942 seconds, very fast and less iterations!

## Find and document the model name of your CPU. You can use the commands below.

Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8705G CPU @ 3.10GHz
