# TDT4200 Problem Set 6

## What are the limitations of using cooperative groups to sync the whole grid at once?

The following limitations apply to cooperative groups when the whole grid is used:
- All the blocks in the grid must fit onto the GPU at the same time â†’ size constraints
- Calling such kernel is a bit more verbose
- Early returns are not an option anymore
- Thread divergence can be an issue, though this is also generally the case
